We all know that it can be hard sometimes to find new application ideas that you could build in order to either improve or learn a new programming language or framework.

**Tip**: When writing reusable code, turn into [**Bit components**](https://blog.bitsrc.io/bit.dev). Then you can easily share and reuse it across all your apps and projects, to easily build better modular software applications faster. It‚Äôs [open source](https://github.com/teambit/bit), give it a try.[Share reusable code components as a team ¬∑ BitEasily share reusable components between projects and applications to build faster as a team. Collaborate to develop‚Ä¶bit.dev](https://bit.dev/)

In this article we‚Äôre going to look into 15 app ideas which are:

* great to improve your coding skills üí™;
* great to experiment with new technologies üÜï;
* great to be added in your portfolio to impress your next employer/client üìÅ;
* great to be used as examples in tutorials \(articles or videos\) üìÉ;
* easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features üëå;

And on top of that, each app idea has:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented;
3. A list of _bonus features_ which are option, but ‚Äúgood-to-have‚Äù;
4. All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project

We divided these app ideas into **three tiers** based on the knowledge and experience required to complete them. The tiers are: **Beginner**, **Intermediate** and **Advanced**.

In this article you‚Äôll find 5 ideas from each tier.

## 1. Countdown Timer <a id="c255"></a>

Tier: 1-Beginner

We all have important events we look forward to in life, birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays to name a few. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have an app that counts down the months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to an event? Countdown Timer is just that app!

The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing display of the he months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered event.

### Constraints <a id="b46b"></a>

* Use only builtin language functions for your calculations rather than relying on a library or package like [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/). This assumes, of course, that the language of your choice has adequate date and time manipulation functions built in.
* You may not use any code generators such as the [Counting Down To](https://countingdownto.com/) site. You should develop your own original implementation.

### User Stories <a id="c06b"></a>

* User can see an event input box containing an event name field, an date field, an optional time, and a ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button.
* User can define the event by entering its name, the date it is scheduled to take place, and an optional time of the event. If the time is omitted it is assumed to be at Midnight on the event date in the local time zone.
* User can see a warning message if the event name is blank.
* User can see a warning message if the event date or time are incorrectly entered.
* User can see a warning message if the time until the event data and time that has been entered would overflow the precision of the countdown timer.
* User can click on the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button to see the countdown timer start displaying the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the event takes place.
* User can see the elements in the countdown timer automatically decrement. For example, when the remaining seconds count reaches 0 the remaining minutes count will decrement by 1 and the seconds will start to countdown from 59. This progression must take place from seconds all the way up to the remaining days position in countdown display.

### Bonus features <a id="bf13"></a>

* User can save the event so that it persists across sessions
* User can see an alert when the event is reached
* User can specify more than one event.
* User can see a countdown timers for each event that has been defined.

As a Web Developer you‚Äôll be asked to come up with innovative applications that solve real world problems for real people. But something you‚Äôll quickly learn is that no matter how many wonderful features you pack into an app users won‚Äôt use it if it isn‚Äôt performant. In other words, there is a direct link between how an app performs and whether users perceive it as usable.

The objective of the Shuffle Card Deck app is to find the fastest technique for shuffling a deck of cards you can use in game apps you create. But, more important it will provide you with experience at measuring and evaluating app performance.

Your task is to implement the performance evaluation algorithm, the Xorshift pseudorandom number generator, as well as the WELL512a.c algorithm if you choose to attempt the bonus feature.

### User Stories <a id="a03b"></a>

* User can see a panel containing a text box the user can enter the number of rounds into, three output text boxes to contain the starting time, ending time, and total time of the test, and two buttons ‚Äî ‚ÄòJS Random‚Äô, ‚ÄòXorshift‚Äô.
* User can enter a number from 1 to 10,000 to specify the number of times \(or rounds\) the selected random number is to be executed.
* User can click one of the three buttons to start the evaluation of the selected random number algorithm. The random number algorithm will be executed for the number of rounds entered by the user above.
* User can see a warning message if number of rounds has not been entered, if it is not within the range 1 to 10,000, or if it is not a valid integer.
* User can see a tabular output area where the results of each algorithm are displayed ‚Äî algorithm name, time started, time ended, and total time.
* User can see a warning dialog with a ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô and a ‚ÄòOK‚Äô button if the number of rounds is changed before all three tests have been run.
* User can click the ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô button in the warning dialog to dismiss the dialog with no changes.
* User can click the ‚ÄòOK‚Äô button in the warning dialog to clear the output area and close the warning dialog.

### Bonus features <a id="e4df"></a>

* User can see a third algorithm button ‚Äî ‚ÄòWELL512a.c‚Äô.
* Developer should review the output and determine why the fastest algorithm is faster than the slowest algorithm.

## 15. Survey App <a id="c6a6"></a>

Tier: 3-Advanced

Surveys are a valuable part of any developers toolbox. They are useful for getting feedback from your users on a variety of topics including application satisfaction, requirements, upcoming needs, issues, priorities, and just plain aggravations to name a few.

The Survey app gives you the opportunity to learn by developing a full-featured app that you can add to your toolbox. It provides the ability to define a survey, allow users to respond within a predefined timeframe, and tabulate and present results.

Users of this app are divided into two distinct roles, each having different requirements:

* _Survey Coordinators_ define and conduct surveys. This is an administrative function not available to normal users.
* _Survey Respondents_ Complete surveys and view results. They have no administrative privileges within the app.

Commercial survey tools include distribution functionality that mass emails surveys to Survey Respondents. For simplicity, this app assumes that surveys open for responses will be accessed from the app‚Äôs web page.

### User Stories ‚Äî General <a id="5e90"></a>

* Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can define, conduct, and view surveys and survey results from a common website
* Survey Coordinators can login to the app to access administrative functions, like defining a survey.

### Defining a Survey <a id="45af"></a>

* Survey Coordinator can define a survey containing 1‚Äì10 multiple choice questions.
* Survey Coordinator can define 1‚Äì5 mutually exclusive selections to each question.
* Survey Coordinator can enter a title for the survey.
* Survey Coordinator can click a ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô button to return to the home page without saving the survey.
* Survey Coordinator can click a ‚ÄòSave‚Äô button save a survey.

### Conducting a Survey <a id="6727"></a>

* Survey Coordinator can open a survey by selecting a survey from a list of previously defined surveys
* Survey Coordinators can close a survey by selecting it from a list of open surveys
* Survey Respondent can complete a survey by selecting it from a list of open surveys
* Survey Respondent can select responses to survey questions by clicking on a checkbox
* Survey Respondents can see that a previously selected response will automatically be unchecked if a different response is clicked.
* Survey Respondents can click a ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô button to return to the home page without submitting the survey.
* Survey Respondents can click a ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô button submit their responses to the survey.
* Survey Respondents can see an error message if ‚ÄòSubmit‚Äô is clicked, but not all questions have been responded to.

### Viewing Survey Results <a id="51f0"></a>

* Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can select the survey to display from a list of closed surveys
* Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can view survey results as in tabular format showing the number of responses for each of the possible selections to the questions.

### Bonus features <a id="11a9"></a>

* Survey Respondents can create a unique account in the app
* Survey Respondents can login to the app
* Survey Respondents cannot complete the same survey more than once
* Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can view graphical representations of survey results \(e.g. pie, bar, column, etc. charts\)

### Useful links and resources <a id="d275"></a>

Libraries for building surveys:

* [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/Overview/Library/)

Some commercial survey services include:

* [Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)
* [Traversy](https://youtu.be/SSDED3XKz-0)
* [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)

### Example projects <a id="1fec"></a>
