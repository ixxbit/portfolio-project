![Five pillars in forming the awsWell-architected framework](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2856%29.png)

### AWS Well-Architected <a id="AWS_Well-Architected"></a>

The [**Well-Architected Framework**](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf) has been developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. Based on five pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization — the Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time.

The [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/) is now available. The user guide can be located [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/).  

APN Partners are available to help you along the way as you build and manage your workloads. [Engage an AWS Well-Architected Partner.](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/partners/)  If you are an APN Partner interested in joining the Well-Architected Partner Program, [click here](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/well-architected-program).  


### Build using a structured approach <a id="Build_using_a_structured_approach"></a>

The AWS Well-Architected Framework includes strategies to help you compare your workload against our best practices, and obtain guidance to produce stable and efficient systems so you can focus on functional requirements.

You can get started by downloading the AWS Well-Architected Framework whitepaper [**PDF**](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf)**.**
